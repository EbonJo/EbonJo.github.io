           Introduction

            My idea is to start an aesthetic club. The club’s mission is to help people explore their aesthetics and to help others learn more about what satisfies their eyes. I would want my club to become a non-toxic learning environment that is also fun. This idea speaks to me because I find interests in certain aesthetics( art related ones and profile related ones).


        This idea may only interest a few people who have an interest in drawing, fashion, music, and even anime(manhwa,manga, webtoons etc). Aesthetics are all about appreciating beauty. For anyone who isn’t so comfortable with trying out a new style because of insecurities, this should be of help because the main goal is to find the aesthetic for everyone and help them be comfortable with it. This will add value into the community due to it keeping kids occupied for something solely for the sake of enjoyment, even for adults. The hours can vary because it being an online club would benefit better.
-it will save some time for the busy people.
-will make it accessible for people not in the same district.
-will also help people too shy to leave their comfort area, because being comfortable is a goal.

This club will not be age-limited and will be on an online platform.
