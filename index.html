Introduction

            My idea is to start an aesthetic club. The club’s mission is to help people explore their aesthetics and to help others learn more about what satisfies their eyes. I would want my club to become a non-toxic learning environment that is also fun. This idea speaks to me because I find interests in certain aesthetics( art related ones and profile related ones).


Body

        This idea mainly serves the people who have an interest in arts(drawings, fashion, and even music). Aesthetics are all about appreciating beauty. Anyone who isn’t so comfortable with trying out a new style because their unsure would fit in well, because the main goal is to find the aesthetic for you. This will add value into the community due to it keeping kids occupied for something solely for the sake of enjoyment, even for adults. The hours can vary because I feel like making it an online club would serve a better purpose.
People who are too shy to meet in public can just send a picture of their clothes and describe their interests
Can save time from busy people
Reduce possible danger
Make it more accessible for people not in the same district


Conclusion

This club will be for many people of age. The club will be from a social media source so many people can take part.
